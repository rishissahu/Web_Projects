Project 1: Parallax Effect

The parallax effect implementation project is a website design project that showcases the popular parallax scrolling technique. This technique creates a sense of depth and dimensionality by moving background images or elements at a slower pace than the foreground elements as the user scrolls down the page.

This project involves creating an HTML structure for parallax sections, applying CSS styles to position the elements and create the parallax effect.
