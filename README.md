Project 1: Parallax Effect

The parallax effect implementation project is a website design project that showcases the popular parallax scrolling technique. This technique creates a sense of depth and dimensionality by moving background images or elements at a slower pace than the foreground elements as the user scrolls down the page.

This project involves creating an HTML structure for parallax sections, applying CSS styles to position the elements and create the parallax effect.

Project 2: Product Card

The simple product card web project is a small but visually appealing web page that showcases a product using a card design. This project is created using HTML and CSS and can be used as a starting point for creating product pages or e-commerce websites.

The project consists of a single product card that displays an image of the product, a brief description, and a price. The card is designed using a clean and modern layout, with a subtle shadow effect to create a sense of depth. The project also uses responsive design techniques to ensure that the product card is displayed properly on different screen sizes.
